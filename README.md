# DomainGeneralization
This repository provieds official implementation of the models achieving SoTA Domain Generalization results on PACS dataset. In addition, this repository also provides the code to reproduce the results on Classwise Domain Generalization (Classwise-DG).

# Overview


# Usage 
For replicating the results on PACS dataset using different modeling choices, please refer to https://github.com/VAIBHAV-2303/DomainGeneralization/tree/main/Table1_comparing_effects_of_IID_methods.

For replicating the results for comparing the performance of different models with and without RSC setting on PACS, VLCS and Classwise-DG setting, please refer to https://github.com/VAIBHAV-2303/DomainGeneralization/tree/main/Table3_effect_of_RSC_and_Table4_classwiseDG.
